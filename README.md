# BMI
 This code is calculating a person's BMI (Body Mass Index), BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and daily calorie needs based on inputs like height, weight, age, gender and activity level.
 So in summary, it takes user inputs, applies medical formulas for BMI and BMR, calculates calories needed and prints out a weight/nutrition recommendation for the person.
